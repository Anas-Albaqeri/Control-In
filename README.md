Contorl-In is a literature review, research paper and solution proposal that was the capstone project for the civic engagement and community building program, part of the American Middle East Partnership Initiative.   
The paper addresses the big gap in computer illiteracy between female and male students in Yemen and suggests a fiesable solution that accommodates for the ongoing difficult political and economic state of the country.
