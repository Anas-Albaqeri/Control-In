## Abstract

Control-In is designed to address the stark computer illiteracy among female students in Sanaa due to educational inequality and outdated systems. This program targets middle school female students, initially focusing on Sanaa's five largest public female schools, with support from local NGOs and the aim of eventual recognition by Yemen's Ministry of Education.

## Introduction

### Project Title

**Control-In: An Anti-Computer Literacy Program for Female Secondary School Students in Sanaa**.

### Problem Statement

The lack of basic computer exposure among female students in pre-university education has led to a significant loss of opportunity and interest in computer science fields at the university level.

### Background

Yemen's educational system has not been updated for over 30 years, leaving a gap in computer education and making students unaware of the technological world around them.

### IT Infrastructure in Yemen

Yemen is one of the least digitized regions with inadequate IT infrastructure, resulting in widespread computer illiteracy.
